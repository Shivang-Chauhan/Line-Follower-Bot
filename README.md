## Introduction

Welcome to the Line Follower Bot project! This is a simple autonomous robot that follows a line on the ground using sensors. The bot is designed to navigate through a predefined path by detecting and following a contrasting line, making it a fun and educational project for enthusiasts interested in robotics and computer vision.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the Line Follower Bot on your own hardware.

### Prerequisites

- List all the hardware components required for the bot (e.g., microcontroller, motor driver, sensors).
- Mention any software dependencies needed (e.g., Arduino IDE, libraries).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
2. 
2. Open the Arduino IDE (or any compatible platform) and load the `line_follower_bot.ino` sketch from the cloned repository.

3. Connect the hardware components following the circuit diagram provided in `/docs/circuit_diagram.png`.

4. Upload the sketch to your microcontroller.

## Usage

Explain how to operate and interact with the Line Follower Bot:

1. Power on the bot and place it on a surface with a contrasting line to follow.

2. The bot should now start following the line. You can adjust the speed and sensitivity parameters in the code to optimize its performance based on the track's characteristics.

3. To make modifications or enhancements, refer to the code comments and documentation within the sketch.

## Contributing
